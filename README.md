# 🧠 Introduction

In a world where digital content is largely consumed visually or audibly, individuals with visual or speech impairments often face significant challenges in accessing web information. This Chrome Extension aims to bridge that gap by offering a fully inclusive browsing experience that transforms text-based content into **Morse vibrations**, **spoken summaries**, and **multilingual translations** — all triggered with a single click.

This project combines **Morse Code feedback**, **AI-based summarization**, **multilingual text-to-speech**, and **tactile vibration feedback**, empowering users to experience websites in a way that's inclusive, accessible, and intuitive.

# 🧩 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Based Summarization**  
  Automatically extracts and summarizes the key content of any webpage using AI models.

- 🌐 **Multilingual Translation**  
  The summarized text is translated into multiple user-friendly languages (configurable).

- 🔈 **Text-to-Speech Support**  
  The summary is spoken aloud using the browser's speech synthesis feature in the chosen language.

- 📳 **Morse Code Vibration Feedback**  
  The same summarized content is converted into **Morse code** and played through:
  - Device **vibrations** (for smartphones/tablets with Vibration API support).
  - **Visual simulation** (for laptops/desktops using blinking visuals and text indicators).

- 🧩 **Seamless Integration**  
  Once the extension is installed, a **floating button** appears on every website. Clicking this button:
  1. Captures the page's readable content.
  2. Summarizes and translates it.
  3. Speaks the translated summary.
  4. Provides tactile Morse feedback.
